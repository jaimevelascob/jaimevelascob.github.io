This project is about a dog and cat classifier using Python and Tensorflow. 

# Files:

    ![](/img/tree.png?raw=true "shot1")
    In the root folder we find the **.bin** and **model.js** generated previously when training the model with python and tensorflow together with the *index,html* that represents the visual code of the web page.

  ## js
    In **main.js** we write the code linked to the html to make the web page interactive.

  ## css
    In **now.css** we write the code linked to the html to add color and shape to the web page.
